# Online Event Ticketing Platform
## High-Availability AWS 3-Tier Solution for Real-Time Event Booking

### 1. Executive Summary
**Ticketing-App** is a multi-event web application platform designed to handle online ticket reservations for various events (e.g., live concerts, sports). The system is specifically engineered to resolve network bottlenecks and database overload by utilizing an asynchronous decoupled processing mechanism and message queuing on AWS.

---

### 2. Concept & Objectives (Problem Statement)

#### 2.1 Context & Problem
*   **System Purpose:**
    **Ticketing-App** is a dedicated online event ticketing platform designed specifically to handle high concurrency and traffic spikes during time-limited ticket releases ("flash sale" events).
*   **Target Audience:**
    The platform serves two primary groups: end-users (ticket buyers) who demand a seamless and lag-free booking experience, and event organizers (B2B clients) who require a highly stable, crash-free system to protect their brand reputation.
*   **Problem Statement:**
    Traditional ticketing platforms frequently suffer from server crashes or database connection exhaustion when thousands of users attempt to purchase tickets simultaneously. **Ticketing-App** resolves this bottleneck through a decoupled architecture integrated with message queues, ensuring that no booking requests are dropped or lost.


#### 2.2 Specific Goals
*   **Desired Output:** 
    * A fully automated 3-tier cloud infrastructure.
    * A comprehensive Monitoring system: CloudWatch Dashboards, centralized Logs, and automated Alerts/Alarms sent via email/SNS.
    * A detailed end-to-end Workshop deployment guide.
*   **Success Criteria:** 
    * API Response Time remains under 200ms under heavy load.
    * Data integrity is guaranteed: No lost booking messages, and zero double-bookings thanks to SQS FIFO.
    * The system scales precisely (Auto Scaling) when load is simulated.

#### 2.3 Program Alignment
*   **FCAJ / AWS Use-case:** 
    The project accurately simulates the high-load challenges of real-world e-commerce systems, directly applying the core AWS services (Elastic Beanstalk, RDS Multi-AZ, SQS, ElastiCache, CloudFront) taught in the First Cloud AI Journey (FCAJ) program.
*   **Cloud Focus:** 
    The solution deeply focuses on High Availability, Security, and Scalability—the core philosophies of cloud computing, perfectly aligning with cloud infrastructure evaluation criteria.
*   **Proposed Solution:**
    Implement a decoupled architecture on AWS:
    1.  **Frontend:** Hosted on **Amazon S3 Static Website Hosting** for cost efficiency and crash-resistant page loading.
    2.  **API Gateway & Application Load Balancer (ALB):** Routes and balances incoming traffic to Backend API instances.
    3.  **Backend Tier (Elastic Beanstalk):** Receives booking requests, performs rapid preliminary validations, immediately publishes messages to **SQS FIFO**, and returns a "Pending" response to the client.
    4.  **Worker Tier (Elastic Beanstalk Worker):** Consumes messages from the SQS FIFO queue in exact order, processes bookings, and updates the database.
    5.  **Database & Caching:** Utilizes **RDS Proxy** for connection pooling to shield RDS PostgreSQL, while **ElastiCache Redis** caches user sessions and event information to offload read queries from the database.
    6.  **Auth & Notifications:** Integrates **Cognito** for managed user authentication, and uses **SNS + SES** to trigger automated alerts and ticket confirmation emails.
*   **Benefits and ROI (Return on Investment):**
    *   **Resource & Cost Optimization:** Auto Scaling configurations run a minimum of 2 instances and scale up to 4 during high-traffic ticket sales, eliminating paid idle resources.
    *   **High Reliability:** The SQS FIFO mechanism ensures zero double-bookings. RDS Multi-AZ and Redis replicas provide rapid failover without service disruption.
    *   **Strong Security:** Application servers, databases, and cache clusters are isolated in Private Subnets, accessible only through NAT Gateways and ALBs.

| **Total** | **Estimated Monthly Total** | | **~ $293.47** |

{{% notice note %}}
**Production Instance Configuration Recommendation:** To ensure reliable and stable performance under high concurrency and prevent resource starvation (CPU/RAM exhaustion), core compute and database services including EC2 Beanstalk, RDS PostgreSQL, and ElastiCache Redis **must utilize instance types of `medium` size or higher** (e.g., `t3.medium`, `db.t3.medium`, `cache.t3.medium`). Avoid using `micro` or `small` instances in production environments as they are highly susceptible to CPU throttling and memory exhaustion under traffic spikes.

### 7. Risk Assessment

#### Risk Matrix

| Identified Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Database Connection Pool Exhaustion** | Medium | High | Utilize **RDS Proxy** connection pooling and implement ElastiCache Redis read caching. |
| **Lost or Out-of-Order Bookings** | Low | High | Use **SQS FIFO** (exactly-once processing) and redirect transaction failures to a **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**. |
| **Cloud Cost Spikes** | Medium | Medium | Configure **CloudWatch Budget Alarms** at 80% and 100% thresholds. Enforce ASG limits. |
| **Unauthorized Access / Breaches** | Low | High | Enforce security group chaining, keep application servers and databases in Private Subnets, and encrypt data at rest via KMS. |

#### Contingency Plan
*   **Disaster Recovery:** Utilize RDS Automated Backups and Snapshots to perform Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR), ensuring no loss of critical booking data in the event of a major data or infrastructure failure.
*   **Failed Booking Re-processing:** If order processing fails at the Worker tier, it lands in the DLQ. Admin notifications are dispatched via SNS, and script utilities can re-ingest the message after the database state is resolved.

---

### 8. System Processing Flows & Technical Strengths

The system utilizes an **Event-Driven Microservices** architecture to decouple user-facing operations from background tasks. The core workflows and architectural characteristics include:

#### 8.1 Core Processing Flows

*   **Authentication Flow:** 
    Integrated with Amazon Cognito for identity management. API requests are authenticated using JWT validation middleware (`aws-jwt-verify`), ensuring secure and stateless authorization between the client and backend services.
*   **Virtual Waiting Room & Concurrency Control:** 
    To handle high concurrency during ticket sales, a virtual waiting room is implemented using **ElastiCache Redis**. When processing a booking, the system applies a distributed locking mechanism on Redis to reserve tickets temporarily, mitigating race conditions and preventing overselling.
*   **Asynchronous Background Processing:** 
    Using **Amazon SQS FIFO**, resource-intensive tasks are offloaded from the main API. Operations such as payment webhooks (MoMo IPN), e-ticket generation, and SES/SNS notifications are processed asynchronously by backend Workers. This ensures the primary API remains highly responsive.
*   **Reservation Lifecycle & Automated Cleanup:** 
    Reservations are granted a limited time window. If a payment is not completed or the user cancels, a `RESERVATION_EXPIRED` event is queued in SQS. The Worker tier consumes this event and performs a transactional database rollback (updating the booking status to 'cancelled' and releasing ticket rows). Simultaneously, it dynamically increments the available ticket inventory in Redis and removes the distributed locks. This automated cleanup ensures unpurchased tickets are rapidly made available to other users in the virtual queue, maximizing inventory utilization.

#### 8.2 Architectural Strengths

*   **Scalability and Decoupling:** 
    The Frontend, Backend API, and Worker tiers operate independently, allowing targeted auto-scaling based on the distinct load of each tier. The Backend API scales based on CPU utilization (scale-out when average CPU exceeds 70%), while the Worker tier scales based on SQS queue length (Message Backlog). SQS acts as a buffer to handle traffic spikes without overloading the PostgreSQL database.
*   **Data Consistency:** 
    The combination of Redis distributed locks and SQS FIFO (exactly-once processing) guarantees strict data consistency across ticket reservations and payment processing, routing any failures to a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for debugging.
*   **Modern Frontend Stack:** 
    Built with Next.js, the frontend provides Server-Side Rendering (SSR) capabilities and leverages React Query for optimized data fetching and state management, ensuring a robust user experience under heavy load.

---

### 9. Expected Outcomes
*   **Technical Improvements:**
    *   Responsive API endpoints with response times below 200ms by offloading heavy work to background workers.
    *   No application downtime or double-bookings during ticket spikes.
*   **Long-Term Value:**
    *   Creates a reusable, production-ready, high-availability AWS 3-tier architecture template for transactional e-commerce workloads.
    *   CI/CD pipelines reduce deployment errors, raising overall code quality and release agility.
